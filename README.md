# Grazioso Salvare Dashboard

- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

Grazioso Salvare needed to identify promising candidates for dog search and rescue training. This project was
aimed at meeting this need by creating an interactive data visualization dashboard.

- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The main screens included in the project were a data table showing various attributes of animals within shelters,
an interative map showing the location of animals, and a pie chart showing the distribution of breeds.
The dashboard featured a dropdown which allowed users to filter based on the rescue category.
It also allowed users to select individual records of the data table and see the location of each record on the
map component.
Overall, the design succesfully provided an interactive way for users to query and visualize data.

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

While creating the project, I approached everything in an iterative fashion. I started with a small peice of the required functionality, tested it, and then
moved on the the next piece. This ensured each individual modlue of the project was working as I expanded the components and features.
By leveraging the same approach, I believe I can successfully tackle more complex projects create working software.

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

- Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

- In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
